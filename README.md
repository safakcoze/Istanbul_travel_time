# Reachable Istanbul in an hour by using Travel Time API.

The map has been visualized by taking into account the districts of Beyoğlu and the Historical Peninsula - where tourists and locals are the most - with a walking distance of 5 minutes to 1 hour.

According to the analysis, as a tourist, many important places can be seen in Fatih and Beyoğlu with a walking distance of 30 minutes. 

In this analysis, I used QGIS, and also used TravelTime API to generated isochrones. Visualized using the location selection tool via QGIS.

Data used: IMM - Road Layer
